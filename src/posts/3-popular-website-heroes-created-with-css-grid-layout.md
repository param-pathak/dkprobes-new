1. Jacob's law - Users spend most of their time on other sites, so they expect your site to work the same way as other sites. 
Websites do better the most standardized the design is.

2. Law of Common Region - Elements tend to be perceived into groups if they're sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary.
Common region can be created using a boundary or a background, or both.

3. Law of Aesthetic - Users perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that's more usable. People are more tolerant of minor usability issues
when the design of a product or a service is aesthetically pleasing.

4. Fitt's law - The time it takes someone to select an object on the screen depends on how far the cursor is from the object, and the size of the object.
Longer the distance and smaller the target size, the longer it takes.

5. Goal Gradient law - Tendency to approach a goal increases with proximity to the goal.
The closer users are to completing a task, the faster they work towards reaching it.

6. Law of proximity - Objects that are nearer tend to be grouped together

Proximity helps users understand and organize information faster and more efficiently

7. Miller's law - The average person can keep only 7(+/- 2) items in their working memory.

Organize content into smaller chunks to help users understand, process and memorize easily.
